# Initial Planning for Project3 Gardens app
 - One of my hobby is gardening. So, I am planning to create an app with gardens. 
 
 ## Landing Page
 - Home as link 
 - AllGardens as link
  
 ### AllGardents page
 - All gardens link should display list of gardens.

 ### Garden details page
 - Specific garden details page should display details of the garden.

 ## Future Improvements
 - In the Garden details page should also display associated plants to that garden type.
